# Time Series Forecasting Using CNN

We implemented a time series forecasting model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, specifically leveraging the Conv1D (1D Convolutional Layer) approach. The Conv1D layer is well-suited for time series data because it allows the model to capture spatial patterns and dependencies across time steps, which is crucial for accurate forecasting. The model was trained to predict future values by learning from past observations, processing sequential data through the convolutional layers to detect temporal patterns. This architecture enhances the model's ability to generalize by extracting relevant features from the data at various time scales. The model was evaluated using a set of validation data, and performance metrics were calculated to measure its forecasting accuracy.
