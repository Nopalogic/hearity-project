# Overview

This analysis leverages hearing data to explore the relationship between noise exposure in industrial environments and hearing impairment. The dataset includes various hearing thresholds for patients across different frequencies, highlighting the distribution of hearing levels, and the patients experience. Special attention is given to identifying patterns in hearing loss that caused by prolonged exposure to loud environments, such as factories or workplaces. The **goal** is to break down how loud sound exposure affects ears or hearing.

The machine learning model in this project aims to predict hearing loss based on these patterns, using summary statistics and visualizations to better understand the data and underlying trends. This approach will provide insights into the gradual decline in hearing, specifically in occupational settings and offer predictive capabilities for early detection and preventive measures for workers exposed to harmful noise levels.
